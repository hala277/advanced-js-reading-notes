## What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a technique of advanced access control that restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization. The levels of access that employees have to the network are referred to as jobs in RBAC.

## EXAMPLES OF ACCESS CONTROL BASED ON ROLE
One role-based access control example is a set of permissions that allow users to read, edit, or delete articles in a writing application.

## BENEFITS OF role-based access control
RBAC improves overall security as it relates to compliance, confidentiality, privacy, and access management to resources and other sensitive data and systems. Selective access: RBAC systems can support users having multiple roles at the same with specific permissions for each role.
