# Stacks and Queues

## What is a Stack? 
*A Node-based data structure is referred to as a stack. Each Node refers to the Node after it in the stack, but not to the one before it.*

## The phrase that frequently used in stack :
1. push: When nodes or items are added to a stack, they are pushed.
2. Pop: Removed nodes or items from the stack are popped.
3. Top: This is the top of the stack.
4. Peek: When you peek, you'll see the value of the stack's top Node.
5. isEmpty: If the stack is empty, IsEmpty returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

## Stacks follow these concepts:

1. FILO(First In Last Out)

*This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.*
