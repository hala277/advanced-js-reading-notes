## Ethics in the workplace

I did read this article [The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e) and let me tell you that it just makes me re-think about a lot of things because I was just yesterday thinking that we cant heart, anyone, by coding at least we can't kill anyone but what I did saw that we can if we didn't think about what does this app will do to the other people is it going to take someone life or is it going to steal someone privacy?! and if it will then don't do it, just don't. 

## Ethics in Technology 

I did read this article [Self Driving Car Ethics](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2017/11/21/self-driving-cars-ethics/804805001/) and Obviously, the subject of self-leadership and ethics is a thorny one because the lives of one or several people are determined by accidents. The idea of programming a car to harm something as small as a child, maybe a child, to save several people is a scary topic only to think about, or that it makes the life of the person inside it more important than the lives of several people. Also scary, by what right would I make this car kill all these people, so I think the issue is thorny and no clear and frank decision can be made.

## Tech Company Principles
I liked Google's goals for AI applications, it is a clear goal for everything related to software as an example:
1. Be socially useful.
2. Avoid creating or promoting unfair bias.
3. They are built and tested for safety.
4. Be accountable to people.
5. Incorporate privacy design principles.
6. Adhering to the highest standards of scientific excellence.
7- Be available for uses that comply with these principles.

All of these goals must be taken into account when developing or designing any kind of software
